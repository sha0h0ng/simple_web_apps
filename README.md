# Simple Web Applications

This repository contains a collection of simple web applications created for my personal use or prototyping purposes. The main goal is to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to generate code based on my requirements and to continuously refine it with additional prompts.

As mentioned, these projects are primarily for my own use or prototyping. If you choose to use them in a production environment, you do so at your own risk. However, you are welcome to use any part of the code.

Most of these projects utilize technologies such as Express.js, ReactJS, Supabase, and PostgreSQL.
